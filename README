*todo*

Open python3 venv with $source .venv/bin/activate

The enviroment takes the next parameters:
	- render_mode -> 
			- 'rgb_array' -> returns an array of rgb values for the current board state 
			- 'human' -> renders the current board state as a plot
			- 'training' -> renders and does nothing

	- observation_mode ->
			- 'rgb_array' -> makes the observation space a box of rgb values for the whole board 
			- 'piece_map' -> makes the observation space an 8x8 array of pieces

	- claim_draw -> 
			- True/False -> check for fifty-move rule or threefold repetition each step

	- render_steps -> 
			- True/False -> render the board every given number of steps

	- steps_per_render ->
			- Int -> the number of steps per rendering of the board

	- reward_type -> 
			- 'sparse' -> only apply reward at the end of an episode 
			- 'dense' ->  apply rewards at the end of every step

	- use_eval ->
			- 'stockfish' -> use the stockfish chess engine for evaluation of the intermediate rewards
					#TODO - add path to stockfish engine as a variable for the user to enter
			- 'material' -> use a simpler material based evaluation for intermediate rewards
